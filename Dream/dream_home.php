<p><b>Sidney Sheldon</b> perfectly describes: <i>“Libraries store the energy that fuels the imagination. They open up windows to the world and inspire us to explore and achieve, and contribute to improving our quality of life.”</i> <b>PPVC</b> is committed to make available to the learners community, the learning resources through a single-window. We deliver one of the largest collections of periodical and digital media content editorially selected to support novice researchers. We aim to simplify the research process and empower novice researchers to more easily and efficiently choose their research topic and find authoritative information to support their research claim.</p>

<div class="home_content">
<p>Digital books and other texts are increasingly coming under the control of distributors and other gatekeepers rather than readers and libraries. Digital libraries bring information to users in real time. They gives us access to a large variety of multimedia and multi‐type documents created by integrating content from many different heterogeneous sources that range from repositories of text, images, and audio‐video, to scientific data archives, and databases. <b>PPVC</b> will provide a seamless environment where the co‐operative access, filtering, manipulation, generation, and preservation of these documents will be supported as a continuous cycle.  Users of the library will be both consumers and producers of information, either by themselves or in collaborations with other users. </p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="home_content">
<p><b>PPVC</b> always focuses on the service aspect of our digital library. We strongly believe, <i>“Knowledge is power”</i> and we aim to make all knowledge accessible to anyone, anywhere and anytime. Users should have access to their own reference library to carry with wherever they go. They should be able to exchange ideas and their thoughts with everyone willing to learn. We aspire and hope to be the very platform and contribute to education and knowledge.</p>
